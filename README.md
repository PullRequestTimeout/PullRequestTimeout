# About Me

Hi, I'm Jacob! Snowboarder, mountain biker, adventurer, coffee nerd, and web developer from Australia, living in British Columbia, Canada. Currently building a couple of projects with vanilla JS while learning React.

## Current Projects

 - [Gooey Startpage](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/gooey-startpage): Gooey (GUI) is a startpage to replace the browser's default new tab in the form of a Firefox-Addon. Using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS as a project to practice fundamentals, API calls, and build a CRUD GUI from scratch. Drawing from [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/) for some inspiration.

 - [Rooted In Motion](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/rooted-in-motion): A landing page website for a local manual therapy/osteopathy business located in Rossland, BC.
