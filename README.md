# About Me

Hi, I'm Jacob! Snowboarder, mountain biker, coffee nerd, and web developer from Australia, living in British Columbia, Canada. Currently maintaining a couple of live projects built with vanilla JS while working on a new MERN-stack project.

## Current Projects

-   [Dirt Surfer](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/dirt-surfer) is a forecasting webapp for moutainbike trail conditions initially focusing on Rossland BC and surrounding area, and then expanding to other regions over time. Frontend built using React with Material UI, backend API built using Express and MongoDB. Backend repo is [Dirt Server](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/dirt-server) bacause I think I'm funny.

-   My portfolio - [jacobeli.dev](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/jacobeli.dev) - currently in the design and early building stage using Svelte. Another collaboration with [Sean Makura](https://seanmakura.webflow.io/) after the great work he did on Rooted in Motion project. More to come in the next couple of weeks.

## Past Projects

-   [Gooey Startpage](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/gooey-startpage/): Gooey (GUI) is a startpage to replace the browser's default new tab in the form of a Firefox-Addon. Using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS as a project to practice fundamentals, API calls, and build a CRUD GUI from scratch. Drawing from [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/) for some inspiration. [Repo](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/gooey-startpage).

-   [Rooted In Motion](https://rootedinmotion.ca/): A landing page website for a local manual therapy/osteopathy business located in Rossland, BC. Work includes photograpy/editing, development and deployment. Web Design in collaboration with [Sean Makura](https://seanmakura.webflow.io/).
