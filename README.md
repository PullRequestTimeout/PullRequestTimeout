# About Me

Hi, I'm Jacob! Snowboarder, mountain biker, adventurer, coffee nerd, and web developer from Australia, living in British Columbia, Canada. Currently building some things with vanilla JS while learning React.

## Current Projects

 - [Gooey Startpage](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/gooey-startpage): Gooey (GUI) is a startpage to replace the browser's default new tab in the form of a Firefox-Addon. Using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS as a project to practice fundamentals, API calls, and build a CRUD GUI from scratch. Drawing from [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/) for some inspiration.

 - [1023 Aerials](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/1023-aerials-master): A portfolio/landing page website for a friend's new drone videography/photography business. Work includes video and photo editing, web design, development and deployment.
