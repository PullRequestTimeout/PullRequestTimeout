# About Me

Hi, I'm Jacob! Snowboarder, mountain biker, coffee nerd, and web developer from Australia, living in British Columbia, Canada. Currently maintaining a couple of live projects built with vanilla JS while working on a new fullstack React project and my portfolio using Svelte.

## Current Projects

-   [Dirt Surfer](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/dirt-surfer) is an AI-powered forecasting webapp for moutainbike trail conditions initially focusing on Rossland BC and surrounding area, and then expanding to other regions over time. Frontend built with React using Material UI, backend API built using Express and MongoDB. Backend repo is [Dirt Server](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/dirt-server) bacause I think I'm funny.

-   My portfolio - [jacobeli.dev](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/jacobeli.dev) - currently under construction using Svelte. Another collaboration with [Sean Makura](https://seanmakura.webflow.io/) after the great work he did on Rooted in Motion project. More to come in the next week or two.

## Past Projects

-   [Gooey Startpage](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/gooey-startpage/): Gooey (GUI) is a startpage to replace the browser's default new tab in the form of a Firefox-Addon. Using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS as to strengthen fundamentals, utilise an external API, and build a client-side CRUD interface from scratch. Drawing from [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/) for some inspiration. [Repo](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/gooey-startpage).

-   [Rooted In Motion](https://rootedinmotion.ca/): A landing page website for a local manual therapy/osteopathy business located in Rossland, BC. Work includes photograpy/editing, development and deployment. Web Design in collaboration with [Sean Makura](https://seanmakura.webflow.io/).
