# About Me

Hi, I'm Jacob! Photographer, web developer, and entrepreneur from Australia, living in British Columbia, Canada. I ran a small business before moving to BC, then after recieving my Permanent Residency in Canada, taught myself to code through the pandemic and have been freelancing since. Although I initially planned to pick up a job in the industry, the frustration of the job search in my remote area prompted me to start a small agency instead. I'm a firm believer in starting a project before you know how to finish it, and learning as you go, and Pixel Mountain Creative is that project.

## Current Project

-   [Pixel Mountain Creative](https://pixelmountain.ca) is a small web development agency that I started in 2023. The goal of the agency is to provide affordable, high-quality websites to small businesses and individuals in the West Kootenays of British Columbia. The agency currently operates more as a collective of freelancers, with myself as the primary developer and photographer, as well as a network of designers and other creatives that I can call on for larger projects. The agency is currently in the process of building a portfolio and establishing a client base.

-   [B & T's Hard Knock Cafe](https://thehardknockcafe.ca) is a current Pixel Mountain Creative project. Stay tuned for more!

## Previous Work

-   [Secret Spots](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/secret-spots) is a webapp built with SvelteKit and Firebase that allows users to keep a personal logbook of their favourite locations with a maps API, and record descriptions and notes of various visits to the location. Ultimate goal of the app is make it a PWA and build up an active userbase to gain more experience managing a live service.

-   [Dirt Surfer](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/dirt-surfer) was an AI-powered forecasting webapp for moutainbike trail conditions initially focusing on Rossland BC and surrounding area. Frontend built with React using Material UI, nodeJS backend API built using Express and MongoDB. Backend repo is [Dirt Server](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/dirt-server) bacause I think I'm funny. Deployed the API for a month to determine the viability and accuracy of the data, however while the data generated was reasonably worthwhile, the server costs outweighed the potential usefulness of the app given the constantly shifting nature of the environment and impossibilty to forecasts events like downed trees etc.

-   [jacobeli.dev](https://jacobeli.dev/) - My personal portfolio, built using Svelte. Another collaboration with [Sean Makura](https://seanmakura.webflow.io/) after the great work he did on Rooted in Motion project. [View repo here!](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/jacobeli.dev)

-   [Gooey Startpage](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/gooey-startpage/): Gooey (GUI) is a startpage to replace the browser's default new tab in the form of a Firefox-Addon. Using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS as to strengthen fundamentals, utilise an external API, and build a client-side CRUD interface from scratch. Drawing from [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/) for inspiration. [View repo here!](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/gooey-startpage).
