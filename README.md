# About Me

Hi, I'm Jacob! Photographer, web developer, and entrepreneur from Australia, living in British Columbia, Canada. I have a background in small business, and after teaching myself web development starting in 2020, am currently in the process of growing a creative web agency in Rossland, BC. I'm a firm believer in starting a project before you know how to finish it and learning as you go, and Pixel Mountain Creative is that project.

## Current Project

-   [Pixel Mountain Creative](https://pixelmountain.ca) is a small web development agency that I started in 2023. The goal of the agency is to provide affordable, high-quality websites to small businesses and individuals in the West Kootenays of British Columbia. The agency currently operates as a collective of freelancers, with myself as the primary developer and photographer, as well as a network of designers and other creatives that I can call on for larger projects. The agency is currently in the process of strengthening its portfolio and expanding our client base.

## Previous Work

-   [Bialkowski Gallery](https://bialkowskigallery.ca/) is a Shopify based e-commerce solution for a landscape artist based in Rossland, BC. Pixel Mountain assisted in a redesign, branding, photography and videography for the digital store. We also made significant improvements to the user experience, and assisted in marketing and strategy. Pixel Mountain Creative designed and created a custom-coded website for the business, as well as providing an expanded repository of branding asssets, photography, and graphic design.

-   [B & T's Hard Knock Cafe](https://thehardknockcafe.ca) is a static landing page website for B&T's Hard Knock Cafe restaurant and bar based in Rossland, BC. 

-   [Secret Spots](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/secret-spots) is a webapp built with SvelteKit and Firebase that allows users to keep a personal logbook of their favourite locations with a maps API, and record descriptions and notes of various visits to the location. Ultimate goal of the app is make it a PWA and build up an active userbase to gain more experience managing a live service.

-   [Dirt Surfer](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/dirt-surfer) was an AI-powered forecasting webapp for moutainbike trail conditions initially focusing on Rossland BC and surrounding area. Frontend built with React using Material UI, nodeJS backend API built using Express and MongoDB. Backend repo is [Dirt Server](https://github.com/PullRequestTimeout/dirt-server) bacause I think I'm funny. Deployed the API for a month to determine the viability and accuracy of the data, however while the data generated was reasonably worthwhile, the server costs outweighed the potential usefulness of the app given the constantly shifting nature of the environment and impossibilty to forecasts events like downed trees etc.
